============
## Introduction
The bug reported with tracking number BUG-001 refers to a problem in the functionality of the web page http://www.neurosalut.com/, as users encounter difficulties when trying to add their contact data in the contact form, since the email input field does not allow entering information without having to manually delete the default value in the placeholder. In addition, the application does not perform the required data verification and does not display a success message after submitting the data. This report will detail the expected and actual behavior and steps to reproduce the problem and provide visual evidence of the problem.
